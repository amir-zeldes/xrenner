`xrenner <https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/xrenner/>`_ (eXternally configurable REference and Non Named Entity Recognizer) is a highly configurable, language independent coreferencer and (non) named entity recognizer, written in Python. It is built to analyze natural language input and recognize what kind of entities (people, places, objects, abstractions...) appear in them and how they are referred to (recognize that *Grace Murray Hopper* can be the same person as *she* in context).
